Then the mentioned the times of the season were when flooding usually happened, which was when farmers expected it, and planned around it. The farmers said that they experienced particularly damaging flooding if unusual flooding occured later in the season.</p> <p>Below you can see average rainfall and the times that the farmers talked about for different areas in the Sadullapur region. Ive roughly highlighted example windows for the usual flooding in blue, and damaging later flooding in orange.</p> <p></p> <p>Below is the set of ranked years that farmers said the were hurt by flooding, along with the years that had high rainfall in the higher flooding time of the season.  I set the frequency of the payouts to 30% which is more often than insurance typically pays out in order to get a sense of if the model was capturing the loss years, even if not strongly enough for insurance financing.</p> <p></p> <p>You can see that the early part of the season only hits one of the problem years.  This could mean that the timing is wrong, the satellite is wrong, or the farmer recollections are wrong. In any case, its not the best sign. And below, as you might have guessed I would put, is the figure with the late flood bad years.</p> <p></p> <p>In that figure, you can see that the later \"damaging flooding\" sums of rainfall have noticable floods in 4 out of the 5 farmer recollected years. There are also lots of \"false alarms, of small floods in other years, which is usually bad for an index, but at this stage of the design, with simple sums, this gives us vaulable insights.  A helpful sign is that the biggest years have pretty much the worst floods.

In the actual R4 insurance project, many farmers wanted an index that was like the one in decads 6-17, because they wanted to de-risk loans for long cycle crops.  The choice of early season vs later season start generally depended on the village, and was closely driven by how big the early seasonal \"bump\" in rainfall was.
