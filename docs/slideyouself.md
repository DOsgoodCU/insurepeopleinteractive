# Design improvement

You can explore the farmers debate of if rainfall starting around decad 7 is more related to vulnerability than rainfall starting in decad 18.

The below is an interactive tool to evaluate and co-design indexes.  It is part of our public domain [DESDR](https://columbia-desdr.github.io/) open toolkit. 

It has all of the tables and figures we have just worked through **but it also has controls**

Click on the tool below, notice how the matching changes as you drag the sliders for "CHIRPS (Early Season)".

- **type your email in the Login box in the tool**
- drag the sliders for the "CHIRPS (Early Season)" to be more focused on the rainfall starting around decad 7 and extending 5-10 decads.
- pick the timing you prefer
- Write down the start and end decad for "CHIRPS (Early Season)"
- **making sure your email** is entered in the login box, **click on "SAVE"**
- Login: once you have saved your choices, you can type your email in the login box then click on login to see what you entered
- You can change your answer as many times as you want, I think.

**IF THE BOX BELOW IS BLANK, OPEN AN INCOGNITO BROWSER AND PASTE:**

And note that it may take a few minutes to load because it downloads everything in advance in order to keep functioning if connectivity is lost.
